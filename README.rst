Ansible F5
==========

|docs badge|

Introduction
------------

This repository provides the foundation for working with F5 devices and Ansible.
The architecture of the modules makes inherent use of the BIG-IP SOAP and REST
APIs as well as the tmsh API where required.

This repository is an **incubator** for Ansible modules that we would like to
have upstreamed over the course of time. The modules in this repository **may be
broken due to experimentation or refactoring**.

If you want to download the stable modules, they are shipped with Ansible
automatically. In-between major releases of Ansible, new `stable modules can
be found here`_.

These modules are freely provided to the open source community for automating
BIG-IP device configurations using Ansible. Support for the modules is provided
on a best effort basis by the F5 community. Please file any bugs, questions or
enhancement requests using `Github Issues`_

One last ask. I'm curious who has Ansible in house and is considering using it
with BIG-IP. If you've got the time, consider sending me an email from your
organization introducing yourself and what you do. I love getting email.

Your ideas

We are curious to know what sort of modules you want to see created. If you have
a use case and can sufficiently describe the behavior you want to see, open
an issue here and we will hammer out the details.
